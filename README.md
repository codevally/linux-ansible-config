# Configuration for Ansible

An experimental configuration for [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com).

## Set Up ##

To set up Ansible on an OS X workstation:

    ./do.sh setup-admin
    cp ./ansible.cfg.example ./ansible.cfg

## Usage ##

Ansible provides three main commands:

* *ansible-playbook* - to execute all of an Ansible playbook on the specified systems
* *ansible* - to execute an individual shell command or Ansible module on the specified systems
* *ansible-vault* - to encrypt or decrypt any individual YAML file that Ansible uses.

Both *ansible-playbook* and *ansible* require you to specify the group of systems that the commands will run on, and use *-i* to specify the inventory file or directory that lists the specified systems. The *all* group is a built-in group that automatically includes all of the systems in the specified inventory.

    ansible GROUP -i INVENTORY OPTIONS

If a command fails on any system in the group, Ansible automatically create a *retry* file that lists all of the systems where the command failed.

For example, use the *-a* option to execute a shell command:

    ansible all -i inventory -a /usr/bin/uptime

Use *-m* to execute an Ansible module:

    ansible all -i inventory -m ping
    ansible all -i inventory -m setup

The *ping* module checks that Ansible can connect to the remote system. The *setup* module returns information about the remote system.

To run a playbook:

    ansible-playbook -K -i inventory my_playbook.yml

The *-K* option means that Ansible will prompt you for the password of your account on the remote system in order to use *sudo*.

Add *--syntax-check* to test the Ansible playbook without running it:

    ansible-playbook --syntax-check -K -i inventory my_playbook.yml

Add *--check* to simulate the effect without making changes to the target systems:

    ansible-playbook --check -K -i inventory my_playbook.yml

If the playbook requires data from a file that has been encrypted with *ansible-vault*, add  *--ask-vault-pass*:

    ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -K -i inventory my_playbook.yml

Enter the password for the encrypted files when prompted.

### Creating a New Server with Ansible ###

To create a new server on Amazon Web Services using Ansible and the EC2 API:

    ./do.sh create-ec2 SECURITY_GROUP_NAME SUBNET_ID KEYPAIR_NAME

For example:

    ./do.sh create-ec2 sg-c7bf09dc subnet-4c754137 my-keypair

This relies on the presence of environment variables for the AWS access key and AWS secret key, e.g. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_KEY.

To create a new Linode using Ansible and the Linode API:

    ./do.sh create-linode LINODE_NAME

To create a new server on Digital Ocean using Ansible and the Digital Ocean version 1 API:

    ./do.sh create-droplet DROPLET_NAME

## Directory structure ##

For convenience, the Ansible playbooks are in the root of this project.

* ansible.cfg.example - Example configuration file for Ansible
* examples/ - Various other templates and examples
* filter_plugins/ - Custom filter plugins
* host_vars/ - Variables for individual host systems
* inventory/ - Lists of host systems
* group_vars/ - Variables for groups of systems  
* library/ - Custom Ansible modules
* roles/ - Custom roles used by the Ansible playbooks
* scripts/ - Utility scripts

## Passwords ##

You must specify the SHA512 hashed version of a user password when you set it through Ansible. By default, Mac OS X does not generate the same hashes as Linux, so use this command to generate a valid hash:

    ./do.sh hash-password

Enter the password that you would like to use at the prompt.

Use the [Vault](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_vault.html) feature to encrypt any YAML file that stores password variables.
