## Start Monit in the background (run as a daemon):
#
  set daemon 120            # check services at 2-minute intervals
#   with start delay 240    # optional: delay the first check by 4-minutes (by
#                           # default Monit check immediately after Monit start)
#
#
## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omitted, Monit will use 'user' facility by default. If you want to log to
## a standalone log file instead, specify the full path to the log file
#
# set logfile syslog facility log_daemon
  set logfile /var/log/monit.log
#
#
## Set the location of the Monit id file which stores the unique id for the
## Monit instance. The id is generated and stored on first Monit start. By
## default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.id.
#
# set idfile /var/.monit.id
  set idfile /var/lib/monit/id
#
## Set the location of the Monit state file which saves monitoring states
## on each cycle. By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.state. If
## the state file is stored on a persistent filesystem, Monit will recover
## the monitoring state across reboots. If it is on temporary filesystem, the
## state will be lost on reboot which may be convenient in some situations.
#
  set statefile /var/lib/monit/state
#
## Set the list of mail servers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be
## specified using a comma separator. If the first mail server fails, Monit
# will use the second mail server in the list and so on. By default Monit uses
# port 25 - it is possible to override this with the PORT option.
#
# set mailserver mail.bar.baz,               # primary mailserver
#                backup.bar.baz port 10025,  # backup mailserver on port 10025
#                localhost                   # fallback relay
set mailserver {{ monit_email_sender_host }} port {{ monit_email_sender_port }} username "{{ monit_email_sender }}" password "{{ monit_email_sender_password }}" using tlsv1 with timeout 30 seconds

## By default Monit will drop alert events if no mail servers are available.
## If you want to keep the alerts for later delivery retry, you can use the
## EVENTQUEUE statement. The base directory where undelivered alerts will be
## stored is specified by the BASEDIR option. You can limit the maximal queue
## size using the SLOTS option (if omitted, the queue is limited by space
## available in the back end filesystem).
#
  set eventqueue
      basedir /var/lib/monit/events # set the base directory where events will be stored
      slots 100                     # optionally limit the queue size

set mail-format { from: monit@{{ machine_hostname }} }
#
#
## You can set alert recipients whom will receive alerts if/when a
## service defined in this file has errors. Alerts may be restricted on
## events by using a filter as in the second example below.
#
set alert {{ monit_email_recipient }}        # receive all alerts
## Do not alert when Monit start,stop or perform a user initiated action
# set alert manager@foo.bar not on { instance, action }
#
#
## Monit has an embedded web server which can be used to view status of
## services monitored and manage services from a web interface. See the
## Monit Wiki if you want to enable SSL for the web server.
#
 set httpd port 2812 and
    use address localhost            # only accept connection from localhost
    allow localhost                  # allow localhost to connect to the server
    allow admin:{{ monit_password }} # require user 'admin' with this password
    allow @adm                       # allow users of group 'adm' to connect
